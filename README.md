# SDM-stadtrat_dresden_metascrape
download all documents from Stradrat Dresden and extract structured and semantic data from these pdfs not just plain text

This is the scraper to get the files and the converter that uses pdftohtml on console (for Linux and Windows available).

This is just the beginning to analyze the converted html and get some more structured, semantic metadata out of the government data, that was caged into PDF before.
